      <h3><strong>
        An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware.
           It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a computer is useless.
          The three most common operating systems for personal computers are Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.
      </strong></h3>
      <strong><h2>My Expectation:</h2></strong>
      <strong><h3>To have in deapth knowledge about the working of computer system understanding the concepts of Operating System is important. Operating System is the only thing that
         makes your bare metal (desktop, tablet, phone, etc) run, be usable to work with.
         Knowledge of OS will be very useful to pursue career in CS.</h3></strong>
