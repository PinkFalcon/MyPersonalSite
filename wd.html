      <h3><strong>
        Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; itâ€™s the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a
           seamless user experience. Web design is important because it impacts how our audience perceives your brand. The impression we make on them can either get them to remain on
            our page and learn about our business or leave our page and turn to a competitor. A good web design helps us keep our leads on our page.

      <strong><h2>My Expectation:</h2></strong>
      <strong><h3>I found this subject very creative. During my B.C.A degree, I have not given much efforts and time to this subject but day by day it's becoming more and more interesting
        for me. Till the end of my first semester, I'would like to create some
        awesome and colourful websites that can also interact with the user.</h3></strong>
