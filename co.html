      <h3><strong>
          Computer architecture and Organization focuses on the function and design of various components necessary to process information digitally. The study of computer
          architecture and organization focuses on the interface between hardware and software, and emphasizes the structure and behavior of the system. As computer users, we
          probably do not have to worry about this anymore than we need to know what our cars look like under the hood in order to drive them. We can certainly write high label
          language programs without understanding how these programs execute. We can use various application packages without understanding how they really work. But what happens
          when the program we have written needs to be faster and more efficient or the application we are using does not do precisely what we want? As Computer Scientists, we need
          a basic understanding of computer system itself in order to rectify these problems.

      <strong><h2>My Expectation:</h2></strong>
      <strong><h3>From the childhood, I have always been curious to know how a computer works.
        Sometimes, to debug a problem understanding of hardware is required. So, I'm excited to learn the organisation and architecture of the computer system. </h3></strong>
