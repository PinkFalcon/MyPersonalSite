      <h3><strong>
      C is a middle-level programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie during the early 1970s while working at AT&T Bell Labs in the USA.C is highly portable and is used
           for scripting system applications which form a major part of Windows, UNIX,and Linux operating system.C is a general-purpose programming language and can efficiently work
           on enterprise applications, games, graphics, and applications requiring calculations, etc.
      </strong></h3>
      <strong><h2>My Expectation:</h2></strong>
      <strong><h3> C programming language is quite often the starting point for all developers.To learn the basics of programming C is the best language to start with.
        If I master C programming,I will be able to understand the essentials of several other programming languages with ease.
