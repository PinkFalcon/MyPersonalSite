      <h3><strong>
        Data Structure is the combination of data objects which gives a way of collecting and handling data in the computer so that it can be used. Their various types are arrays,
          Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc. Data Structures are used extensively in nearly every aspect of Computer Science for simple as well as complex calculations. They are practiced
          in all such areas such as AI, Graphics, Operating System, etc.Data Structures are a crucial part of several computer algorithms as they allow programmers to do data
          management efficiently. A wise selection of data structures can improve the performance of a computer program or algorithm in a more useful way.
      </strong></h3>
      <strong><h2>My Expectation:</h2></strong>
      <strong><h3>The data structure and algorithm provide a set of techniques to the programmer for handling the data efficiently.So, for me to understand the core concepts of data handling
        data structure is an important subject.If the programmer does not know about data structure and algorithm, they may not be able to write efficient code to handle the data.
        The data structure concepts can be implemented in any programming language.They can write the code in any programming language with minimal effort. If the programmer does not
        know the pre-defined algorithmic techniques, it may take the longer time to resolve the problem. </h3></strong>
