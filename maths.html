    <h3><strong>Discrete Mathematics is the Foundation of Computer Science.Programming is all about dealing with numbers and building logic around them. Mathematics is one of the most
    important tools for programmers to develop sophisticated applications.Without the knowledge of mathematics, a programmer is basically handicapped because mathematics
    provides the analytical skills required in Computer Science</strong></h3>
  <strong><h2>My Expectation:</h2></strong>
  <strong><h3>Mathematics has always been one of my favourite subjects. As we know, algorithm is an application of mathematics to solve real world computing problems.So learning
    mathematics will help me to build my logic more effectively in algorithms and to solve computing problems.Mathematics Teaches the Usage of Algorithms.In order to succeed
    in any discipline of Computer Science, it is much better to inculcate a love of Mathematics as that will help me tremendously.
